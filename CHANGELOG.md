# Changelog

## 1.7.0

- Add note to README.md about why a package could be flagged one day but not the next ([68ce0e0](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/commit/68ce0e03285139593d33a5859d85bc8d1146c206))
- Make verbose printing more informative ([#548](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/548))

## 1.6.3

- Update dependencies, including `openssl` to version 0.10.70 ([#502](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/502))

## 1.6.2

- Eliminate reliance on `once_cell` ([f12bb3a](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/commit/f12bb3ad03ce5b5b43424518a2b4bf41268de53b))

## 1.6.1

- Do not consider a package unmaintained because it is stored in a Mercurial repository ([#489](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/489))

## 1.6.0

- Add experimental `--json` option to output JSON ([#464](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/464))

## 1.5.1

- Clone but do not checkout repositories. **WARNING: This change causes the cache to be rebuilt.** Prior to this change, `cargo-unmaintained` could not handle repositories containing paths not supported by the host filesystem. This bug was observed on Windows (e.g., NTFS). Thanks to [@elopez](https://github.com/elopez) whose suggestions contributed to the fix. ([4dc9dc7](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/commit/4dc9dc708ffc414f253736616005e1b3aa7ee291))
- Update list of [known problems](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained?tab=readme-ov-file#known-problems) in README.md ([#451](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/451))

## 1.5.0

- Clarify "newer version is available" message ([#394](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/394))
- FEATURE: Add `--save-token` option to store a personal access token in $HOME/.config/cargo-unmaintained/token.txt on Linux/macOS, or %LOCALAPPDATA%\cargo-unmaintained\token.txt on Windows. Note that the existing means for providing a personal access token (`GITHUB_TOKEN_PATH` and `GITHUB_TOKEN`) continue to work as before. ([9a529aa](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/commit/9a529aadbada51a543b4db94cef21efd2c3f5ffc))

## 1.2.0

- FEATURE: Consider when dependencies were published. Don't report a package as unmaintained just because an incompatible upgrade exists for one of its dependencies, but that upgrade is less than 365 days old (the default). ([#311](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/311))

## 1.1.0

- FEATURE: Allow GitHub token to be passed in `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable; warn when neither `GITHUB_TOKEN_PATH` nor `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set ([9b39e32](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/commit/9b39e320b263910b2a4dc57f0fe6dd6027d7f6fd))

- Eliminate reliance on `octocrab`. (The tests still use `octocrab`, though.) ([#193](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/193))
- Cache repositories on disk between runs ([33585c5](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/commit/33585c5520f9e2ec83fdb8bc34057a12d1a9ab67)

## 0.4.0

- A package passed to `-p` is no longer required to be a dependency. Passing any `NAME` in `cargo unmaintained -p NAME` will cause the package to be downloaded from `crates.io` and checked. ([#136](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/136))
