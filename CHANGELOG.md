## 1.3.0

- FEATURE: Better progress reporting ([#325](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/325))

## 1.2.0

- FEATURE: Consider when dependencies were published. Don't report a package as unmaintained just because an incompatible upgrade exists for one of its dependencies, but that upgrade is less than 365 days old (the default). ([#311](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/311))

## 1.1.0

## 0.4.0

- A package passed to `-p` is no longer required to be a dependency. Passing any `NAME` in `cargo unmaintained -p NAME` will cause the package to be downloaded from `crates.io` and checked. ([#136](https://github.com/trailofbits/cargo-unmaintained/pull/136))
